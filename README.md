# Computing Education Research
A curated list of books, papers and blogs on **Computing Education Research** that I have found useful as a teacher and for my self-study. üìöüìÉüñ•Ô∏è

This was inspired by [Eugene Yan's Applied ML Repository](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml) and [Amy Ko's CER FAQ](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/cer/)
